# Data Science Assignment

This project contains a Jupyter notebook with data analysis and visualization tasks. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the notebook.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

    - Using `venv` (Python 3.6+):

      ```sh
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```

    - Using `conda`:

      ```sh
      conda create --name myenv python=3.8
      conda activate myenv
      ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    - Using `pip`:

      ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    - Using `conda`:

      ```sh
      conda install --file requirements.txt
      ```

## Execution

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the notebook**

    In the Jupyter interface, navigate to `DSAssignment.ipynb` and open it.

3. **Run the cells**

    Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis and visualization tasks.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

The necessary Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Notes

- Ensure your environment is activated before running the notebook.
- If you encounter any issues with the dependencies, check the `requirements.txt` file for the specific versions needed.
